 Java Swing have also used here to build the GUI of this game.

Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.

 i have used jFrame technolodgy here.

 JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components. JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely. Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
